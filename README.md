# Hand-tracking
This project was built as part of the internship selection process. The objective was to create a hand-tracking system that detects when a user approaches a virtual on-screen boundary.  The Catch: No AI libraries (like MediaPipe or OpenPose) were allowed. This solution relies purely on classical Computer Vision concepts
